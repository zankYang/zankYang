## About

Backend developer with 4+ years of experience building APIs and server-side applications, mainly with AdonisJS and Laravel, focused on clean architecture, security, and maintainable code. I hold a degree in Accounting and have strong knowledge of accounting principles and financial processes, which helps me translate business requirements into solid domain models (billing, payments, reporting, and data integrity) and communicate effectively with non-technical stakeholders. I enjoy working with relational databases, migrations, authentication/authorization flows, background jobs, and documentation, and I continuously improve my workflow through testing, automation, and good engineering practices.

---

**Focus areas**
- REST APIs, authentication (JWT/session), authorization (RBAC)
- Database design, migrations, performance basics
- Background jobs, queues, cron tasks
- Testing and documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger when needed)

---

## How I work
- Clean code and consistent architecture
- Defensive programming and input validation
- Logging, error handling, and observability basics
- Documentation-first when collaborating
